# Deed Checker API Solution Documentation

## Problem Summary

The HisabDaily app's deed checker feature was failing in production (Vercel) due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions on the Reminder.dev API. The API only allows requests from `localhost:5173`, making it unusable for deployed applications.

## Solution: Backend Proxy Implementation

### Overview

We implemented a backend proxy solution that allows the deed checker to work both in development and production environments:

- **Development**: Direct API calls to Reminder.dev (works due to CORS allowlist)
- **Production**: Serverless function proxy to bypass CORS restrictions

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Backend Proxy (`/api/deed-checker.js`)

Created a Vercel serverless function that:

- Accepts POST requests with `query` and `language` parameters
- Makes server-side requests to Reminder.dev API (no CORS restrictions)
- Processes and formats the response for consistent frontend consumption
- Includes comprehensive error handling and fallback responses

#### 2. Frontend Updates (`/src/lib/reminderDev.ts`)

Modified the deed verification logic to:

- Detect environment (development vs production)
- Use direct API calls in development
- Route through proxy API in production
- Handle both response formats with proper type checking

### API Endpoints

#### Development (Direct)

```
POST https://reminder.dev/api/search
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "q": "Is smoking permissible (halal) or forbidden (haram) in Islam? Please provide evidence from Quran and Hadith."
}
```

#### Production (Proxy)

```
POST /api/deed-checker
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "smoking",
  "language": "en"
}
```

### Response Format

Both endpoints return the same standardized format:

```typescript
interface DeedVerificationResponse {
  verdict: 'sin' | 'not_sin';
  evidence: Evidence[];
  summary: string;
}

interface Evidence {
  source: string;
  snippet: string;
}
```

### Benefits

1. **Production Compatibility**: Works reliably on Vercel and other deployment platforms
2. **Development Efficiency**: Direct API access in development for faster debugging
3. **Consistent Interface**: Same response format regardless of environment
4. **Robust Fallbacks**: Comprehensive error handling with Islamic guidance fallbacks
5. **Offline-First**: Still prioritizes offline knowledge base for performance

### Alternative Solutions Considered

#### 1. Other Islamic APIs

- **Sunnah.com API**: Requires API key, only provides hadith retrieval (no Q&A)
- **IslamQA.info**: No public API available
- **Dar Al-Ifta**: No public API available
- **Various Islamic APIs**: Only provide Quran, hadith, prayer times (no jurisprudence Q&A)

#### 2. Expanded Offline Knowledge Base

- Could provide more comprehensive coverage
- No external dependencies
- Would require significant manual curation
- Less dynamic than AI-powered responses

#### 3. Alternative AI Services

- No other Islamic-specific Q&A APIs found
- General AI APIs lack Islamic scholarly knowledge
- Would require custom prompt engineering and validation

### Conclusion

The backend proxy solution provides the best balance of:

- **Reliability**: Works in all environments
- **Functionality**: Maintains full API capabilities
- **Performance**: Fast responses with offline-first approach
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns

This implementation ensures the deed checker feature works consistently across development and production environments while providing users with reliable Islamic guidance.

### Testing

- ✅ Development environment: Direct API calls work
- ✅ Production deployment: Proxy handles CORS restrictions
- ✅ Error handling: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- ✅ Type safety: Proper TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Offline-first: Knowledge base checked before API calls
